Why Kwilt Photo Stream:
- Consumers take more photos than ever before;
- Photos are stored everywhere (social media, cloud storage, mobile phone, home…);
- Photos are generally not indexed and easily searchable;
- Consumers don’t remember where their photos are saved and cannot access and use them in their preferred apps and web services;
- When consumers need to access their photos to complete a task, they usually leave your app to go hunting for their digital memories, get sidetracked…and don’t come back!
